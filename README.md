[![mruby-Source-Code-Dictionary](https://github.com/ccmywish/mruby-Source-Code-Dictionary/workflows/Test-Dict/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ccmywish/mruby-Source-Code-Dictionary/actions/workflows/test.yml)

mruby source code names explained using [cr: the Cryptic Resolver](https://github.com/cryptic-resolver/cr.rb). Please refer to its README to see the dictionary's layout and format.

**This repo is inspired by [@tenderlove's CRuby glossary](https://github.com/tenderlove/ruby-glossary) and I will keep track of [mruby's official doc](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/tree/master/doc) to keep it up to date. Welcome contributions!**
